this is going to be a todo app.
the whole UI is going to be made by copy and pasting.
I'm just practicing on the backend side.

featurese:
Login / Registration 

Users:
can store their task in 3 different priority(LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
can Delete / Edit their tasks.
can Done / Undone their tasks.
have the right to be forgotten and completly deleting their account and tasks.
can change their password.

can contact to the admin of the APP.

Admin:

can see the total number of tasks in the APP.
can delete a user for some reason (maybe acting against the site's policy)
can see the total number of sent messages from users.
can see the message from users.
